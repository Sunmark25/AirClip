- ~~Push received content to clipboard (I'm working on this)~~ -- Just need to polish up
- ~~Connect server API methods to database (right now it just outputs or gives set values)~~
- Link Qt and c++ code together (I think this is requried, I haven't had time to look)
    - This means in general just starting the normal c++ code
    - But also linking the user login to the login methods (this invloves sending json to an api path currently)


- Improve API routes (use auth and ~~http params like username?=test)~~
